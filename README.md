# 🚀 Day 1 — Hello World Customizer

### 📌 Project Description
This is the first project of my **100 Days of Python** challenge.  
In this project, I created a simple Python program that:

- Takes the user's name as input   
- Displays it on the screen  

This helps to understand **basic input/output** operations in Python.
